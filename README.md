# Free QR Generator (Angular)

This is a small, simple QR code generator built with Angular.
I made it as an open-source part of a bigger project I’m working on (that one is closed-source), but this piece is free for anyone to use, learn from, or modify.

## What it does

* Lets you type text or a URL
* Shows a QR code instantly
* No servers, no tracking, no nonsense

## How to run it

```bash
npm install
ng serve
```

Then open your browser at **[http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)**.

## Build (if you need it)

```bash
ng build
```
