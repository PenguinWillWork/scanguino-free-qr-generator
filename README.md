# Free QR Generator (Angular)

This is a small, simple QR code generator built with Angular.
I made it as an open-source part of a bigger project I’m working on (that one is closed-source), but this piece is free for anyone to use, learn from, or modify.

## What it does

* Lets you type text or a URL
* Shows a QR code instantly
* No servers, no tracking, no nonsense

## Important note

This code originally lived inside my main project, and I recently moved it into a freshly initialized Angular project here.
Because of that, the project in this repo is not fully set up yet, and some configuration and cleanup still need to be done.
It will be updated to work properly **very soon**.

## How to run it (as for 14.11.25 - read the note above)

```bash
npm install
ng serve
```

Then open your browser at **[http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)**.

## Build (if you need it)

```bash
ng build
```
